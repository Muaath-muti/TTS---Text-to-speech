"""
Keeps a Streamlit Community Cloud app awake by actually opening it in a
real (headless) browser, so the JS bundle loads and a genuine WebSocket
session gets established with the Streamlit server.

A plain curl/requests GET does NOT achieve this — it only downloads the
static HTML shell and exits, without ever running the app's Python script.
Streamlit Cloud's sleep-timer only resets on real sessions like this one.

This script also handles the case where the app has ALREADY gone to
sleep: it detects the "Zzzz... this app has gone to sleep" wake screen
and clicks the "Yes, get this app back up!" button, since a sleeping
app can only be woken by that click — not by any kind of passive visit.

NOTE: this deliberately does NOT wait for Playwright's "networkidle"
state. Streamlit keeps a persistent WebSocket connection open the whole
time the page is loaded, so the network is never truly "idle" — waiting
for that condition can hang until it times out even when the page has
loaded fine. Instead, this waits for specific, meaningful things to
appear or disappear (the wake button, or a short grace period).

It does not attempt to sign in — it doesn't need to. Even the
"Sign in to continue" screen behind Google auth is real content served
by a live Python session, which is exactly what counts as activity.
